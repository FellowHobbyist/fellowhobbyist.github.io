## Hello World

I'm Brian, and this is my personal blog. Simply put, I am a husband, father, and geek. I live, work, and play in Nashville, Tennessee as a Founder at [Gadgetry](http://gadgetry.io) and as the VP of Platform Engineering at [Augeo](https://augeomarketing.com).

As a Founder at [Gadgetry](http://gadgetry.io)  I am focused on sharing practitioner level knowledge and expertise implementing Platform as Code and advanced DevOps capabilities using Open Source Technology, Cloud Based Services, and Industry Best Practices.

As the VP, Plaform Engineering at [Augeo](https://augeomarketing.com) I lead a high performing team of Cloud Architects and Site Reliability Engineers that are focused on cloud migration, open source adoption, and driving continuous improvement efforts through advanced Platform and DevOps capabilities. 


## What I've Done
I am an experienced leader and practitioner who has been working in the field of technology for around 15 years. I have experience working for large Fortune 250 Companies as well as lean Startups. If you want to know more I keep my [Resume](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fellowhobbyist/) updated and available on LinkedIn.

A few things that I think are noteworthy:

* Founded Gadgetry.io specializing in Practitioner Level Engineering Services
* Legacy Co-Lo Datacenter Migration(s) to Amazon Web Services as a 100% Managed Code Base 
* Launched Edo Interactive Platform as a Managed Service (Edo + Visa Europe)
* Co-Creator of a Leadership and Communication Workshop Series at Unum
* Co-Founded NoogaJS JavaScript Community in Chattanooga, Tennessee

These days I am focused on Platform Engineering and Cloud Architecture. I spend majority of my time at Gadgetry and Augeo working with product teams on their migration to the cloud, sunsetting of legacy datacenters, adoption of infrastructure as code, and building DevOps solutions via open source technology.  


## What I Enjoy

I consider myself very fortunate to have developed a rewarding career in technology which also happens to be my passion.  When I am not busy at work I am usually in my home office tinkering around with my own projects. Outside of technology I enjoy the outdoors, cooking, traveling, and coaching soccer.

My Specialties: 

* Platform Engineering
* Cloud Architecture
* Infrastructure as Code
* DevOps and Microservices
* Open Source Technology

I believe that businesses and teams of any size should experience the benefits of a well-equipped platform.  Overall, I am most happy when I am working on projects that deliver significant value and create real momentum. I enjoy collaboration and exploring new opportunities.
